# Arduino-Space-Invaders
Space Invaders interpretation designed for Arduino boards (tested exclusively on Arduino Mega 2560)
Current proof of concept version requires:
- Arduino Board (Mega 2560 should work out of box given proper connection is set up)
- LCD with I2C adapter (non-I2C or some other boards require some manual addressing and proper libraries) 
- Analog Stick set up on A0 (X), A1 (Y) and digital 8 pin (stick button)
- Buzzer set up on the digital pin 7
